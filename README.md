TOP HTML Project - Odin Recipes

This is the first project to complete in TOP and centers
on basic HTML principles taught in the course.  Many times,
I tend to try to over-do projects, but there is so much
more to learn, I plan on just sticking with the basic 
requirements for this project.  I may return in the future
and add to it, but for now I have low expectations.


ASSIGNMENT:
Iteration 1: initial structure
    1. Create an index.html file in the root project folder
        DONE! 1/30/2026
 
    2. Fill out usual boilerplate HTML and add an h1 heading
        "Odin Recipes" to the body.
        DONE! 1/30/2026 

Iteration 2: recipe page

        DONE! 1/30/2026

    2. Create new HTML file in recipes directory and name
        it after the recipe it will contain.  Add boiler-
        plate HTML.
        DONE! 1/30/2026

    3. For now, just include an h1 heading with the recipe
        name.
        DONE! 1/30/2026

    4. Add link in index.html to the recipe just added in the 
        recipe folder.
        DONE! 1/30/2026

    5. Add a link back to the index page in the new recipe
        page for easier navigation.
        DONE! 1/30/2026
