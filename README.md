TOP HTML Project - Odin Recipes

This is the first project to complete in TOP and centers
on basic HTML principles taught in the course.  Many times,
I tend to try to over-do projects, but there is so much
more to learn, I plan on just sticking with the basic 
requirements for this project.  I may return in the future
and add to it, but for now I have low expectations.


ASSIGNMENT:
Iteration 1: initial structure
    1. Create an index.html file in the root project folder
        
    2. Fill out usual boilerplate HTML and add an h1 heading
        "Odin Recipes" to the body.
