TOP HTML Project - Odin Recipes

This is the first project to complete in TOP and centers
on basic HTML principles taught in the course.  Many times,
I tend to try to over-do projects, but there is so much
more to learn, I plan on just sticking with the basic 
requirements for this project.  I may return in the future
and add to it, but for now I have low expectations.


ASSIGNMENT:
Iteration 1: initial structure
    1. Create an index.html file in the root project folder
        DONE! 1/30/2026
 
    2. Fill out usual boilerplate HTML and add an h1 heading
        "Odin Recipes" to the body.
        DONE! 1/30/2026 

Iteration 2: recipe page
    1. Create a new directory called 'recipes'
        DONE! 1/30/2026

    2. Create new HTML file in recipes directory and name
        it after the recipe it will contain.  Add boiler-
        plate HTML.
        DONE! 1/30/2026

    3. For now, just include an h1 heading with the recipe
        name.
        DONE! 1/30/2026

    4. Add link in index.html to the recipe just added in the 
        recipe folder.
        DONE! 1/30/2026

    5. Add a link back to the index page in the new recipe
        page for easier navigation.
        DONE! 1/30/2026

Iteration 3: recipe page content
Add the following content:
    1. A free image of the finished dish under the h1 heading

    2. Under the image, add "Description" heading with a
        paragraph or two describing the recipe

    3. Under the description, add an "Ingredients" heading 
        followed by an unordered list of ingredients

    4. Under ingredients, add "Steps" heading followed by
        an ordered list of the steps needed for making
        the dish

Iteration 4: add more recipes
    1. Add at least two more recipes with identical page
        structrues to the first recipe page created

    2. Don't forget links to new recipes and back to 
        the index page.  Consider using an unordered
        list so they aren't on one line
