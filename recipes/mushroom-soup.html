    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Enjoy a nice pot of hot mushroom soup on a cold winter day! This recipe is simple with 
        few ingredients based off a recipe by 
        <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/anthony-bourdain-mushroom-soup-11890119" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> 
        Anthony Bourdain</a>.  It is quick to throw together, but does take time for the flavors to
        develop.  Not much work, and <em>very</em> worth the wait!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>6 Tablespoons of butter</li>
        <li>1 Onion sliced</li>
        <li>12 oz sliced button mushrooms</li>
        <li>4-6 oz whole button mushrooms</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>1-2 sprigs of parsely</li>
        <li>2 ounces of sherry</li>
        <li>4 Tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>salt & pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons of butter into a pan at medium heat and lightly saute onion until 
            just beginning to become transluscent. (approximately 3-5 mins)
        </li>
        <li>Add remaining butter and sliced mushrooms. Continue to cook for 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in stock and parsley and bring mixture to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce to a simmer and cook for 1 hour. <br>

        </li>
        <li>While soup is simmering, preheat oven to 425 F.</li>
        <li>Toss whole mushrooms in olive oil, salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Spread whole mushrooms on baking sheet and bake 4-5 minutes until just beginning to brown.</li>
        <li>After soup has simmered for 1 hour, blend in blender or use immersion blender to make soup creamy.</li>
        <li>Add whole mushrooms from oven to soup as a garnish, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <p><em>Note:</em> when I used an immersion blender, the soup was not as creamy as I wouldve liked.  It 
        seemed slightly gritty.  In the future, I plan to alter this recipe to instead of sliced, dice 
        mushrooms real small and not blend them.  I will add 1/2 cup of cream or milk, and 2 tablespoons 
        of flour in the last 10 minutes of the saute to make it creamier.
