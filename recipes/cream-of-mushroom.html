    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Our family goes through a <em>LOT</em> of cream of mushroom soup. It goes into many of the 
        dinner casseroles and chicken dishes we make. In the past, we've always used the storebought 
        cans, but now with this easy recipe, we can can our own!  This recipe is for a little over a 
        quarts worth of soup, so scale up the recipe for as much as you want to make!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 stick of butter</li>
        <li>1/2 Onion</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped Mushrooms</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt & pepper</li>
        <li>6 Tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>1 & 1/2 cups bone broth</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat the butter in a pan over medium heat and add onion.  Cook onion 1-2 mins.</li>
        <li>Add rest of ingredients and bring up to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Simmer for 10 minutes.  <br>

        </li>
        <li>Remove from heat.  Cream of mushroom soup is ready for use in dinner or canning.  If canning, prepare
            for hot-jar canning.
        </li>
        <li>For canning, can at 10 lbs pressure (15 lbs for high altitudes) for 90 minutes.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><em>Note:</em> Since I use salted butter, and have some salt in my homemade bone-broth, I do not add more salte 
        as prescribed in the recipe.  I salt to taste when using the cream of mushroom in the recipe for dinner appropriately.
        Also, for a creamier soup, substitute a portion (or all) of the milk for half-and-half.
